#Used to evaluate a pitcher's performance and effectiveness in preventing runs, which is ultimately the goal of pitching.
# BB/9 
closer <- closer %>% mutate(BB_9 = (BB/IP)*9)

# Why is this important?----
#For pitchers, especially relief pitchers like closers, minimizing walks is 
#essential to prevent free base-runners and potential scoring opportunities for the opposing team. 
#A low BB/9 indicates better control and command of pitches.

# Insights----------

## With the stats given, the composite score is a combination of 
# offensive metrics (OBP and SLG), defensive metrics (BB_9 and ERA), and 
# strikeout ability (SO). So, the higher composite score indicates better 
#performance since it represents a pitcher who prevents batters from reaching base 
#(low OBP and SLG), limits walks (low BB_9), strikes out batters effectively, 
#and prevents earned runs (low ERA). 
#Therefore, the top 2 players are in the top 10 based on the composite score,
#however, we also selected players with good stats in 2002 (recruiting year for 
#the position) and their previous salaries. 



#__________________CONCLUSION_______________________________
#Overall our strategy was very simple yet effective: 
#1. To understand important characteristics for each player's Position.
#2. To define needed metrics where necessary.
#3. Create composite metrics to evaluate performance where necessary (in our case for Outfielder and Closer).
#4. Evaluate characteristics of the players who left.
#5. Find substitutes who have equal or lower Salary to those 3 players (separetely due to their differences). 
#And we decided to get players who are not more expensive as other costs will occur due to players substitutions:
#Transfer fees, Relocation Expenses, Training, Lost Revenue, Legal costs, and potentially more.
#6. And get the Top Performing players based on previous metrics.
#7. Finally, we selected TOP-2 Substitute players to propose.
#8. In addition, we provided Final Players Visualizations Comparisons (for each Position): Proposed VS Previous.
#9. It allows our stakeholders to see the current performance of those players.
