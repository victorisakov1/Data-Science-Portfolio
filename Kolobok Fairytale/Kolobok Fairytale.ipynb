    "   INTRODUCTION TO THE FAIRYTALE:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Once upon a time, there was a poor old couple. They lived in a village in an old-old house right by the forest. There was a river running by that forest and the cleanest air. The couple had their own garden and had their own organic food. But this year was colder than others and they had very little food. And one day wife decided to bake a special treat for her husband. And she found out there was just enough flour to make a type of bun called Kolobok. When grandma was done, she placed it on a window-still to cool down...\n",
    "\n",
    "   The story starts here and you will decide the destiny of Kolobok! You will face some difficult choices, meet new characters, and decide what to do to pass this journey.\n",
    "    \n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "   \n",
    "   BUGS THAT ARE NOT YET WORKED OUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For some inputs, you can't combine two answer choices in one, otherwise it will give a mistaken answer.\n",
    "   - If you don't respond - game won't continue and will wait for your input.\n",
    "   - If your answer is not recognized by the code - it will ask you to either try again, where you must select yes or 1 as      an answer, otherwise you will lose.\n",
    "   - For some questions, there is no limit to the amount of times you can put an invalid answer choice.\n",
    "   - For one question, it says [Choose one number] where you must choose a number only. You will have 3 chances to make a        choice, and then it will randomly select the direction for you.\n",
    "   - Some questions where you need to decide the direction (after house stage) will allow 3 attempts and will choose a          direction for you if your choice didn't match the proposed options.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "  INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Choose the directions provided in the game to make Kolobok's next move. In some situations you will be prompted to give names for the characters throughout the journey. Good Luck!"
